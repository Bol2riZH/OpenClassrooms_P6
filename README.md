# PIIQUANTE
## OpenClassrooms Project 6 - back-end (auth - crud - API)

The other side of the web developpement. With this project, now I can say that I know how it works !

How everything is connect and how we can give informations from one side and ask from the other one.

In this project, the front-end was given and developp in ANGULAR. I have to manage to build the baack-end :
- initiate the server
- make the routes, models, controllers, middlewares

**And don't forget the security part**.

As always, I make my best to write clean and dry code.
